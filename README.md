# SubZero Launcher (WinForms)

This is an advanced windows forms UI that I made. This is mostly geared more towards cheats
but this can be used however you want. Below you can see some previews of what it looks like.

# More Info

The login system by default is a simple if text statment. However, [KeyAuth](https://keyauth.cc) is already implemented
so you would just need to uncomment the code and add your keyauth info.

This UI is open sourced, if you use it you must give me credit.
